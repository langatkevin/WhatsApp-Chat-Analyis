[15/01/2024, 5:55:48 PM] Liberata Mbua: If anything, I think they'd be proud. These are people risking their lives to save those who went out. I'd be so proud of my dad

[15/01/2024, 6:02:58 PM] Billionaire: I don't have the rebuttal for this line of argument. But the thing is, coming from a family of cops, it would suck to see them in a bulldozer pan. Doesn't imply I don't appreciate the work they do... But the family goat cannot afford such a moment of vulnerability
[15/01/2024, 6:04:46 PM] Billionaire: The other thing, last time family was caught in a shoot out, I would have paid everything to see them resign immediately after. Nature events ain't no shoot out but putting their life on the line doesn't resonate well with me
[15/01/2024, 6:07:24 PM] Liberata Mbua: 😂😂it's the same way most Kenyans would have a field day if cops were to be beaten up. Those cops have done lots of people dirty😭😂. And yes, they do have a 'reputation' to maintain and being seen in compromising positions doesn't do it😂

[15/01/2024, 6:08:27 PM] Liberata Mbua: It's sad. No one wants their family to be out there taking the bullet for strangers. However, someone has to do it and it is ,unfortunately, I'm their line of duty

Hello everyone,

I have been made aware of an alarming issue whereby students who have registered are receiving emails about possible suspension citing that they haven’t registered for the term and have also not received their stipend because of that. 
If you have ever experienced (now or in the past) this please write your name here. The SRC will send an email to resolve this situation ‎<This message was edited>

[01/02/2024, 2:13:23 PM] ~ Miss Tarawally: *Hi guys, If you have not nominate yet for the Africa opportunity Award, please nominate me*

Here's why I think you should nominate me:

I have consistently seek out opportunities to contribute towards the discussion and participate in programs that are tailored towards the development of Africa even before ALC. Since 2020 I have been part of the Young Africa leaders initiative (YALINETWORK).

At ALC I have continuously engaged in programs and conversation that seek to promote Africa narratives and development.  Studying at ALC and meeting people from the continent has added to my strong believe in the great potential and opportunities in Africa 

I am a strong believer in the potential of Africa and what our generation can do. And I will still continue to work on this strong belief for a better Africa.


Regards,
Sarah

I wanted people to follow their hearts haha; but seeing as the deadline is tomorrow, I have decided to be more proactive. In my journey through ALC with all of you, I have consistently and passionately led culture at ALC, inspired people by my can-do spirit, and shaped the ALC experience when nothing was there. If you look at your ALC experience and see memories shaped by me leading a culture of creativity, action and community on campus, please vote for me for *the leadership award*: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLyEQ4ZxjBHtokHxywdJpOhuuGESHyEYdfYSz3id4We5GAWg/viewform

It's been great doing this phase of life with you guys. I am excited for what the future holds. Stay motivated!

Subject: *GMI Mentorship Opportunity*
Hello everyone,
Last summer, I participated in this amazing business mentorship through Global Mentorship Initiative, and I think it’s something, if you are keen on mentorship and even freshly out school, you would enjoy too.  

It’s a fantastic program where you have an online mentorship with a business professional, and they help you target specific companies for jobs and build a large business network through LinkedIn that will lead to job introductions.
 
The program is 12 one-hour sessions where you meet with your mentor usually once a week.  It covers everything from interview techniques, using keywords in a resume/CV to attract job recruiters, and building a LinkedIn profile that attracts hiring managers.  They have over 6,000 college students in the program.
 
It’s easy to get started, you just need to complete the application here: https://globalmentorship.org/schools/alu/ and then watch a brief orientation video.  Let me know if any questions

Regards,

[23/02/2024, 8:39:00 PM] Billionaire: It's all fun until you realize you had a dollar denominated euro bond, at 10+ interest that has to be paid. Soon it will be due, there will be severe dollar shortage for a country whose big forex earners are unprocessed agricultural produce. Then you will cry when you remember the day you laughed at the Naira
[23/02/2024, 8:40:46 PM] Amos Kasumba: But they have stable electricity supply and Mnangagwa has never addressed an audience in darkness😏
[23/02/2024, 8:41:17 PM] Billionaire: I once told someone to bring me trillion denomination, for art. I guess it was too heavy to carry
[23/02/2024, 8:43:26 PM] Billionaire: All they did was kick the can down the road, the gain against the dollar wasn't a result of balance of trade
[23/02/2024, 8:44:18 PM] Billionaire: It's a ticking time bomb
[23/02/2024, 8:47:28 PM] Langat Kevin: And then there are some countries that never appear in the headlines, for good or bad reasons. Like, what even goes on in Togo?

[23/02/2024, 8:53:47 PM] Billionaire: Not a roast but there is one Kamlesh Patni that pulled the biggest heist in Kenyan history. Then became a pastor and relocated to Zim. Last time I heard about him he was scamming the government in gold dealings while saying praise Jesus. We exported a problem to you guys
[23/02/2024, 8:54:37 PM] Langat Kevin: Because you don't have your own

[23/02/2024, 8:59:47 PM] Billionaire: But printing a note for trillions is equivalent, don't you think?
[23/02/2024, 9:00:34 PM] Reagan: Pole basi

Please note, everytime transport is cancelled  we will inform you. 
Sometimes transport can get delayed but if we don't send comms  for cancelling, it means it will definitely come. 
I don't think it's okay for people to be calling transport interns every morning or any time to just confirm trips.
We have transport schedules which are followed and communication is only necessary if the transport is more than 15/20 minutes late.If its cancelled, you will always know..

[07/03/2024, 9:55:16 AM] Ruth Nyarindo: Typically a history month/ day - i.e women's history month , black history month , pride month, indigenous groups months etc are set to acknowledge forms of historical injustice &  marginalization towards a minority group

There isn't a men's month for the same reason there is a Black history month and no white folk month.

[07/03/2024, 10:00:23 AM] Mbuthia Wa Kamau: In the end, they have provided pathways to celebrate women's day through initiatives like gender affirming surgery and other avenues.

WEATHER: A weather watch for severe storms will be in place until 10 PM Monday

A strong storm warning is in effect in Mauritius and will be in effect until 10 pm tomorrow, according to the meteorological statement issued on Sunday.
Par ailleurs, il y a un système frontal suivi d'un fort anticyclone qui se rapproche de notre région.
Dès le début de cet après-midi, il est envisageable que de fortes houles déferlent dans les endroits côtiers en basse altitude du sud-ouest, du sud et du sud-est pendant les marées hautes.
Clouds associated with the frontal system will affect local weather overnight.
Also, there will be plenty of commotion beyond the reefs, with waves as high as 4 meters.
It is strongly advised for kayakers and the public to go to the sea, especially along the beaches during high tide.

[28/03/2024, 2:01:03 PM] Tiam Lynn: Hi everyone, here are some updates about access to the boardroom in the Learning Commons:

* For the next 2 weeks (could be more), a staff member has booked it from Monday to Friday. So fortunately or unfortunately, we will all have to change our plans if we were planning to use it.

* Outside of that, there has been an update to using that room. Apparently, it has been hard for some people to use the boardroom, hence, before using, one will have to book the room *on Google Calendar* (booking by pasting a paper on the door unfortunately is not valid. But you can put it after having successfully booked and remove it when leaving). 

After booking, you will need to show it to the security team who will be in charge of opening and closing the space. This procedure will be effective even after the 2 weeks. 

If you need guidance on how to book on Google Calendar, feel free to reach out to any RA, @Bridget Chirimbani, @Brian Gathui or myself.

Hello everyone, I hope you are all holding up ok wherever you might be right now.

As you all know we're going through a very rough period in school. We have sadly lost our classmate and friend Tarlen.

Unfortunately, Etian also lost his Mother this morning and Danvick lost his granddad the other day.

We are called upon as a community to stand strong and be in full support in these hard times.

We thus seek your moral, emotional and financial support to assist them as they go through these hard times.
You can support in any way by juice or account transfer

*Juice number- 57149238*

*Account number-000450428516*

*Mpesa - 0742813107*

We shall create an excel sheet and keep everyone updated on the progress daily in this format:
1. Anonymous -  X amount

I pray that the comfort of the Lord remains with us all as we move into the week.

Today is bible study Wednesday, let us meet, to reflect on the word, to be uplifted and strengthened in the spirit.

2 Corinthians 1:3-4 (NIV): "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God."


It will be as usual, in Aksum, 2nd floor from 8pm to 9pm. We look forward to seeing you ‎<This message was edited>

We are kindly requesting that you show up on time tomorrow. As you can see from the invites, the time is 10 am. 

10 am is the time we are leaving campus. Not the time to head to the bus. 

We are kindly requesting that anyone who plans to go for the viewing put in the effort to be there on time. 

On our end, we will do our best for the transport to be on time to match your appreciated efforts.

*On the other end, kindly, pretty please refrain from taking pictures of him tomorrow.*

Thank you all and God bless you

I hope you are all well. I wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation to you all for the unwavering support you extended to my family as our dad continues to conquer cancer. More than you know, your kindness, love, and solidarity have given us a profound sense of strength. 

Through your words of encouragement, heartfelt gestures, generous financial contributions, and prayers, you've not only recalled the immense blessings in my life by being part of this incredible community but also shown me that I have an extended family right here at ALC. To each one of you, Asante ❤️

On a positive note, Dad is progressing well, he is improving as days go by. His eating has improved greatly and we can see gradual improvements in his strength. Hopefully, he will receive a green light to continue with chemo as of next week. I hope that we continue to keep him in prayers 🙏🏽

[13/04/2024, 2:00:42 PM] Mbuthia Wa Kamau: @23054870649 
Nigerian guy living in Sweden smartly
married a Swedish lady, so as to be
legally certified with resident permit, but
the lady was not aware of this. 
He lied to the lady that he is from Kenya because of the bad reputation of Nigerians in that part of Sweden. 
After their wedding, the lady returned home one day and informed the guy that she met her
friend, a Swedish lady also married to a
Kenyan and will like them to have a dinner together. 
The Naija guy was disturbed and kept thinking how he will get out of this dark spot. 
He postponed and postponed the proposed dinner until he got tired of postponing. 
Finally the D- DAY came, they all sat down in a
restaurant. 
Our Naija guy was quiet and was sweating profusely in spite of the cold atmosphere of Sweden (-8C). 
The ladies asked their husbands to
communicate in their local dialect since
they are both from same country(Kenya).
The Naija guy being a man of great savvy decided he will just speak Igbo, if the other guy didn't understand, he will claim that he is from another tribe and region in Kenya. 
Then he started, "Nwanne a wum nwafo owerri, owerre nchi ise, I wu kwanu onye olee, daa?
The other Kenyan looked up and replied
"Ah Nwanne, ekele diri chineke, onyena
asuru ndigbo uzo ha. E chekwe m na
enwela m nsogbu taa. Abu m nwafo
AHIAZU Mbaise . Nwanne birikwe o!
They shook hands and embraced each
other to the admiration of the ladies.
Igbo's no dey carry last. Igbo kwenu!

[15/04/2024, 12:33:59 AM] Mbuthia Wa Kamau: threatened why?
[15/04/2024, 12:35:46 AM] Billionaire: EU outrage on trophy hunting in Botswana, to curb the excess elephant population. UK was threatened some consignment would make its way to Hyde park

[15/04/2024, 12:38:11 AM] Billionaire: For Botswana, the trophy hunting is a necessity as the excessive elephant population is destroying property, maiming and killing. When EU complains about it.... Botswana says they should get a shipment, get first hand experience in living with elephants
